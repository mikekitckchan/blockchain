## Purpose of Blockchain

The main purpose of blockchain is to solve "single trust" problem by developing a decentralized system. 

#### What is Single Trust Problem?

In our real world, we are highly relied on a single authority to keep the world moving. For example, the bank acts as a single authority to verify how much money we have in our account, do we have authority to proceed the transaction etc. Imagine that if the bank's system fail and lost all the data, it would be a disaster to all of its customers, or even worse to the society. 

## Features of Blockchain
As mentioned earlier, blockchain is used to solve Single Trust Problem. But how? It is basically done by following features of blockchain

#### Decentralized
In blockchain, there is no one single authority 

#### Distributed Ledger
One of the ways that blockchain used is keeping a ledger book at all participants' record. Taking bitcoin as example, each participant (or we call nodes in bitcoin) would keep a ledger book which showing balance of different accounts. If a transaction is made (or in other words, change in state), all nodes would update its balance at the same time. Also, each nodes would be participate to verify each transaction. This is decentralized.

#### Immutable

## Assymatric Encryption

In order to understand Blockchain better, you have to at least have a brief understanding of what Asymmetric Encryption is. In short, Asymmetric Encryption is an encryption method for a key pair (1 public key and 1 private key) with following features:

1. A Private key can generate a public key;
2. A message can be signed by a private key, and it can be identified using its public key;
3. You cannot reverse engine the private key from its public key

Thus, in the world of Blockchain, a public key would be a public address of the wallet, whilst a private key would be a secret key used to sign a message sent by the sender so that everyone knows it is sent by that particular person.
