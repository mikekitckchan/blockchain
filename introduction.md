## Purpose of Blockchain

The main purpose of blockchain is to solve "single trust" problem by developing a decentralized system. 

#### What is Single Trust Problem?

In our real world, we are highly relied on a single authority to keep the world moving. For example, bank acts as a single authority to verify how much money we have in our account, fund transfer authority etc. Imagine that if the bank's system fail and lost all the data, it would be a disaster to all of its customers, or even worse to the society. 

## Features of Blockchain
As mentioned earlier, blockchain is used to solve Single Trust Problem. But how? It is basically done by following features of blockchain:

#### Decentralized
In blockchain, there is no one single authority. Thus, blockchian system relies on participants to validate transactions and data of the network. These participants is what we call Validator. Larger amount of Validator and larger variety of the Validator, the system or network is more decentralized.  

#### Distributed Ledger
Distributed ledger means each validator would keeping a copy of ledger book. Taking bitcoin as example, each validator would keep a ledger book which showing balance of different accounts. If a transaction is made (or in other words, change in state), all validators would update its balance at the same time. Also, each validator would be participate to verify each transaction. 

#### Consensus
In the world of blockchain, one of the way it need to tackle is how to reach a consensus from validators. Normally, there are a few ways as shown below:

###### Proof of Stake (POS)
This is the simpliest method for the system to reach a consensus. In simple words, validators would vote for a change of state (eg a transaction). If over half of the validators came into agreement, it is assumed that the network came into a consensus. However, in the world of blockchain, participating as a validator has little or no boundary. Thus, it would easy for attacker to register more than half of the validators of the network, attacker might able to validate untrue transaction himself ("51% attack").

###### Proof of Work (POW)

#### Immutable

## Assymatric Encryption

In order to understand Blockchain better, you have to at least have a brief understanding of what Asymmetric Encryption is. In short, Asymmetric Encryption is an encryption method for a key pair (1 public key and 1 private key) with following features:

1. A Private key can generate a public key;
2. A message can be signed by a private key, and it can be identified using its public key;
3. You cannot reverse engine the private key from its public key

Thus, in the world of Blockchain, a public key would be a public address of the wallet, whilst a private key would be a secret key used to sign a message sent by the sender so that everyone knows it is sent by that particular person.
